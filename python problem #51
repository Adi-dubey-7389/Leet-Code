#  Divide Array Into Equal Pairs
"""
You are given an integer array nums consisting of 2 * n integers.

You need to divide nums into n pairs such that:

Each element belongs to exactly one pair.
The elements present in a pair are equal.
Return true if nums can be divided into n pairs, otherwise return false.

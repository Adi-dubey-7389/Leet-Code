# Swap Nodes in Pairs
'''
Given a linked list, swap every two adjacent nodes and return its head. You must solve the problem without modifying the values in the list's nodes (i.e., only nodes 
themselves may be changed.)

class Solution:
    def swapPairs(self, head):
        # Dummy node to simplify edge cases
        dummy = ListNode(0)
        dummy.next = head
        prev = dummy

        while head and head.next:
            first = head
            second = head.next

            # Swapping
            prev.next = second
            first.next = second.next
            second.next = first

            # Re-position pointers
            prev = first
            head = first.next

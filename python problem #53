# Minimum Operations to Make Binary Array Elements Equal to One I
"""
You are given a binary array nums.

You can do the following operation on the array any number of times (possibly zero):

Choose any 3 consecutive elements from the array and flip all of them.
Flipping an element means changing its value from 0 to 1, and from 1 to 0.

Return the minimum number of operations required to make all elements in nums equal to 1. If it is impossible, return -1.

"""
You are given an array nums consisting of positive integers.

We call a subarray of an array complete if the following condition is satisfied:

The number of distinct elements in the subarray is equal to the number of distinct elements in the whole array.
Return the number of complete subarrays.

A subarray is a contiguous non-empty part of an array.

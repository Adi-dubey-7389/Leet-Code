There is a forest with an unknown number of rabbits. We asked n rabbits "How many rabbits have the same color as you?" and collected the answers in an integer array answers where answers[i] is the answer of the ith rabbit.

Given the array answers, return the minimum number of rabbits that could be in the forest.
